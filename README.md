## How It Works

- The video element is controlled using custom HTML buttons and sliders.
- JavaScript connects the buttons and sliders to the video API:
    - `video.play()`, `video.pause()`
    - `video.currentTime`
    - `video.volume`
    - `video.requestFullscreen()`, etc.
- Progress bar updates automatically as video plays, and is clickable to seek.
- Event listeners handle time updates, button clicks, and input changes.
